  STATION 6 TEMPLATE: AI Assistance for [TOPIC]
  ================================================================================

  This template is specifically for Station 6, which ALWAYS follows this format:

  TITLE: "Station 6: AI Assistance for [Topic from Stations 1-5]"

  12-SECTION STRUCTURE:
  1. What You'll Learn (3 insight cards + HAP's confession)
  2. What AI Can and Can't Do
  3. [First Specific Topic Example with AI]
  4. [Second Specific Topic Example with AI]
  5. AI for [Topic] Accessibility
  6. Optimizing [Topic] Performance with AI
  7. Try It Yourself: AI [Topic] Challenge
  8. HAP's Rules for Working with AI (6 numbered rules)
  9. Advanced Prompt Strategies
  10. When NOT to Use AI
  11. Quick Reference: AI [Topic] Tasks
  12. Learning Objectives Checklist

  HAP'S VOICE IN STATION 6:
  - First-person reflection on using AI while learning Stations 1-5
  - Shares specific examples of prompts that worked/failed
  - References Prof. Teeters' guidance on responsible AI use
  - Shows prompt evolution from vague to detailed
  - Emphasizes verification and accountability

  KEY THEMES:
  - AI as assistant, not replacement
  - Accessibility is non-negotiable (always request explicitly)
  - Performance requires explicit prompting
  - Verification is mandatory (you own the code)
  - Detailed prompts get better results
  - Understanding beats speed

        <p><strong>Welcome to Station 6!</strong> After learning all about [STATIONS_1-5_TOPICS], I was feeling pretty
          confident. Then I discovered that AI could help me [TASK] in seconds instead of hours! I was so excited — I
          asked an AI for [SPECIFIC_EXAMPLE], got beautiful code back, and shipped it immediately. Then Prof. Teeters
          tested it and found a critical problem: [SPECIFIC_ISSUE]. She sat me down and explained: "HAP, AI can
          generate code faster than you can type, but it doesn't care about your users the way you should. You own
          every line of code, whether you wrote it or AI did." That lesson changed how I work with AI completely. Let
          me show you what I learned about using AI responsibly for [TOPIC] — the prompts that work, the verification
          that's mandatory, and the rules that keep users safe! 🟠</p>
