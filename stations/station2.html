                    <p>Prof. Teeters pulled up a website showing a list of static site generators. I started
                        scrolling... and
                        scrolling... and scrolling. There were a lot of them!</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">"Pick one," she said with a smile.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">I panicked! They all looked similar. Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Eleventy, Astro, Next.js,
                        Nuxt, SvelteKit... the list went on forever. How was I supposed to know which one was right?</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">"What programming language do you know best?" she asked.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">"Well, it will be JavaScript." I said. "As a web developer I'll need JavaScript and
                        I
                        plan to learn it with you!"</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">"Then you've already narrowed it down significantly. Now let's look at complexity
                        versus
                        flexibility..."</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">That one question changed everything. Instead of comparing fifty tools, I was
                        comparing
                        maybe five. Here's how Prof. Teeters helped me think through the decision... 🟠</p>

                <p><strong>HAP's Discovery:</strong> I used to think picking a tool was about finding "the best one."
                    Prof. Teeters taught me that's the wrong question. The right question is: "Which tool fits MY skills
                    and MY project?" Here are the three insights that helped me choose: 🤯</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 3 Insight cards -->
            <div class="overview-grid mt-2">
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h3><span class="insight-icon">🗣️</span> Language Matters</h3>
                    <p class="stat-large">Your Language</p>
                    <p>Jekyll uses Ruby, Hugo uses Go, Eleventy uses JavaScript. Pick one that matches YOUR
                        skills—because when something breaks (and it will!), you'll need to understand the error
                        messages and debug the code.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h3><span class="insight-icon">📊</span> The Complexity Spectrum</h3>
                    <p class="stat-large stat-teal">Sweet Spot</p>
                    <p>Simple tools (Jekyll) are easy to start but limited. Powerful tools (Gatsby, Next.js) can do
                        anything but require more learning. Eleventy sits in a sweet spot: flexible enough to grow with
                        you, simple enough to start today.</p>

                    <p class="stat-large stat-brown">Just Works</p>
                    <p>Eleventy works out of the box with sensible defaults. No webpack setup, no build configuration,
                        no "starter template required." Just write content and run the build command. That's why I chose

                    <h3>HAP's Confession:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I almost picked Hugo because "fastest builds!" sounded impressive. Then I tried reading the
                            Go template documentation and had no idea what was happening. Fast builds don't help if you
                            can't customize anything!</li>
                        <li>I spent two whole days trying to set up Gatsby before realizing I didn't need React for a
                            simple blog. Grace Hopper appeared and asked, "Why are you making it so complicated?" She
                            had a point. 😳</li>
                        <li>I thought "zero-config" meant "no configuration possible." Turns out it means "sensible
                            defaults with optional configuration." You CAN customize everything—you just don't HAVE to
                            customize everything to get started.</li>
                        <li>I judged SSGs by how pretty their marketing websites looked instead of actually trying them.
                            Prof. Teeters reminded me that a nice website doesn't mean a nice developer experience.</li>

                        <p>"Don't choose a tool just because it's trendy or because someone online says it's the best.
                            Choose the one that fits your skills and your project right now. And with Eleventy, all your
                            main content lives in easy-to-move Markdown files, so you can switch to another system later
                            without losing all of your hard work."</p>

                        <p>After all that research, Eleventy was the clear winner for me. Here's exactly why:</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <ol class="mb-2">
                    <li class="mb-1">
                        <strong>I'm learning JavaScript</strong> — Prof. Teeters says every web developer needs it, so
                        I'm practicing bit by bit. The great part is that Eleventy doesn't force me to be an expert
                        right away. I can build real sites using Markdown and templates while slowly understanding more
                        of the JavaScript behind the scenes. As I learn, I can customize more and more.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-1">
                        <strong>Zero-config actually works</strong> — For fun, I ran <code>npx @11ty/eleventy</code> on
                        a folder with one Markdown <span>index.md</span> file and got a working HTML page. No
                        setup
                        required!
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-1">
                        <strong>Template flexibility</strong> — Eleventy supports Nunjucks, Liquid, Markdown,
                        JavaScript,
                        and more. I started with Markdown, because I know it already, and I'll be learning Nunjucks
                        (more on that later!).
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-1">
                        <strong>The community is helpful</strong> — When I got stuck, I found answers on the Eleventy
                        Discord and GitHub discussions. People were patient with my beginner questions.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-1">
                        <strong>It grows with me</strong> — I started simple, but I've already added custom shortcodes
                        and filters. Eleventy can handle way more complexity when I'm ready for it.
                    </li>

                        <h3>🟠 HAP's Conclusion:</h3>
                        <p>Now that I'm becoming an accomplished web developer who can make great web pages, Eleventy
                            gives me an easy path to build full multi-page sites. I can use its tools with the HTML and
                            CSS skills I already have, and that's enough to create something impressive right away. As I
                            grow, I can add more features whenever I'm ready. I call that a big win for new developers
                            like me!</p>
